# Java Object-Oriented Programming – Module 4

This project is part of a comprehensive full stack developer training program designed to provide hands-on, real-world experience. In Module 4, we focus on the foundational pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java — including classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation — to build modular, scalable, and maintainable software.

Beyond technical skills, this module emphasizes strategic communication, teamwork, and code documentation. By collaborating in teams, documenting design decisions, and presenting solutions, we simulate a real professional development environment.

This repository showcases not only my proficiency in Java and OOP, but also my readiness to contribute to high-quality, collaborative software projects as a full stack developer in training.

## Key Topics

- **Classes and Objects**: Defining reusable code blueprints and creating instances to build object-oriented systems.
- **Inheritance**: Structuring class hierarchies to reuse logic and enhance organization.
- **Polymorphism**: Allowing methods to behave differently depending on the object calling them.
- **Encapsulation**: Securing data and exposing functionality through controlled access points.

## Strategic Communication Focus

- **Team Collaboration**: Working in groups to develop solutions and practice clear communication.
- **Documentation**: Writing technical documentation to express design logic and implementation decisions.
- **Technical Presentations**: Presenting project outcomes and explaining design approaches to improve professional communication.
